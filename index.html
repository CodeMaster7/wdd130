                Arizona is a stunning southwestern state known for its iconic Grand Canyon, red rock formations in Sedona, and the majestic Saguaro cacti that dot the Sonoran Desert. The state experiences dramatic landscapes from pine forests to desert valleys, and offers year-round outdoor activities like hiking, rock climbing, and exploring ancient Native American ruins. Despite the hot summers, Arizona's mild winters and breathtaking sunsets make it a popular destination for both tourists and residents.
